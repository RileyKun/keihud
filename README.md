# KeiHUD
(generic hypnotize hud rip off #9184916 but way cooler)  
My personal HUD for Team Fortress 2.

# Installation:
Drag keihud folder into tf/custom.

# Compatibility?
Compatible with most screen resolutions. Switching it is the same as in regular SunsetHUD.  
My HUD should still retain compatibility with Linux.

# Credits
